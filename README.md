### Objective <br />

*Why?*

- A COVID-19 Dashboard is to raise awareness on the evolution of COVID. The idea is to associate a visualization that shows data relevant to the public with a didactic text on why such evolution is expected. 
- The dashboard is pushed for transparency to states, health care decision makers, providers, and others.
- To gain experience with cloud databases & data warehouses, data integration and data pipeline tools and comparing their extensibility, the integration, and the ease of integration with multiple platforms.
 
 *What?*
- Build a dashboard for COVID-19 data. This contains datasets of daily time-series data related to COVID-19 for over 20,000 distinct locations around the world. The data is at the spatial resolution of states/provinces for most regions and at county/municipality resolutions for the United States. 
- Developed multidimensional data model and enhanced it to meet growing requirements.
- Performed data profiling, data cleansing & data quality on the open COVID-19 dataset from the Google Big Query, Stitch & other flat-files.
- Implemented source system analysis on data sources and compared operational efficiency between Google Big Query and Azure.

*Where?*
- This will be useful for Health and Government officials when they have to make decisions based on results and come up with a strategy to stop this virus.

*Who?*
- This will be by public health and government officials 

*How?*
- Created a pipeline on Talend Pipeline Designer by ingesting/integrating from various sources like Google Big Query, Stitch and other flat files to generate BI dashboards.
